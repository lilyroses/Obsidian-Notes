# House of Ballons/Glass Table Girls
#theweeknd #lyrics

Been on another level
Since you came, no more pain
You look into my eyes
You can't recognize my face
You're in my world now
You can stay, you can stay
But you belong to me
Ooh, you belong to me

If it hurts to breathe, open a window (woo-ooh)
Oh, your mind wants to leave (leave), but you can't go
This is a happy house (a happy house)
We're happy here (we're happy here), in a happy house
Oh, this is fun, fun, fun, fun, fun
Fun, fun, fun, fun Fun, fun, fun, fun

Music got you lost
Nights pass so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
This place will burn you up
Baby, it's okay, them my niggas next door
And they workin' in the trap, so get naughty if you want
So don't blame it on me
That you didn't call your home
So just don't blame it on me, girl
'Cause you wanted to have fun

If it hurts to breathe, open a window (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh, your mind wants to leave, but you can't go (ooh)
This is a happy house
We're happy here, in a happy house
Oh, this is fun, fun, fun, fun, fun (this is fun)
Fun, fun, fun, fun (this is fun to me)
Fun, fun, fun, fun

Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
Bring the 7

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Whatever, together
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenchin' on some super-sized papers

And she bad and her head bad
Escapin', her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib

And we can test out the tables
We've got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors, so I listen to her moans echo

"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey-dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fuckin' beat like he fuckin' told me

"Is that your girl, what's her fuckin' story?
She kinda bad but she ride it like a fuckin' pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talkin' 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude, with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Bring the 707 out

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Bring the 707 out

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Bring the 707 out

La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la I'm so gone, so gone
Bring out the glass tables
Bring the 707 out

Bring the 707 out
Bring the 707 out
