# The First Encounter (of the Sexual Kind)
#memories #journal 

I adore you.

When I first met you, I was interested by you. Curious. 

After the first night we actually hung out together alone, I was so taken with you.

And the next time we hung out, when you picked me up, you were so concerned about my whereabouts. 

By the third or fourth time we hung out, I wanted you. I wanted to rub the stress from your shoulders, and I did. I was turned on by you, and I wanted to turn you on. So I did.

I know you remember that day, because to this day, you still bring it up.

We were in an apartment complex, parked in a spot belonging to someone else, and it was the middle of the day. 

You were stressed about work, and how you were about to lose your job. You were shirtless, as you so often were in those days!

I asked you if I could rub your shoulders, and you said yes. You also told me, "I may have to stop you at some point, though... I don't want to get too turned on."

I took that as a green light.

I crawled into your backseat from the driver's seat, and sat behind the passenger seat, where you were sitting. You already had your shirt off, so all I had to do was pull the lotion out of my bag.

I put a lot of lotion on my hands, and you jumped at first when I touched your skin, because the lotion was cold. It was a hot day, though, just like your body, which is always hot to the touch, and the lotion warmed quickly. 

I gently started rubbing the knots out of your shoulders, and you told me I could put more pressure. I did slightly, and started rubbing up to your neck, even gently running my fingers through the hair at the nape of your neck once the lotion was rubbed in.

You were moving under my touch, enjoying it, with your eyes closed. You kept giving little groans of half pleasure, half reluctance, thinking I was messing with you. 

I reached to the side of your chair and pulled the lever with my right hand, and the back of your seat with my left, to recline your seat.

You were startled and sat forward, but I pulled you back with a whispered, "Shhh... it's okay!" in your ear. Hesitantly, you laid back, and I put my hands back on your shoulders. But this time, instead of rubbing down your back, I started rubbing down your chest.

Your eyes widened a bit as I leaned forward, my long hair tickling your neck, our cheeks nearly touching as I slowly rubbed down your smooth, firm skin. 

That was the first time I ever saw you do your "move" - where you raise your right arm over your head, and bite your left thumb - a move that would become your signature any time I was really turning you on. 

As I rubbed your chest and stomach in slow, sensual circles, and as you were getting distinctly more and more turned on and frustrated, I purred quietly in your ear - "Do you want me to stop?" The answer was an immediate, strained, "N-no, not at all." 

"I just don't want to turn you on too much..." I teased. You didn't have any words this time, just shook your head. As I breathed the words into your left ear, my lips brushed it slightly. You shivered a little, and  goosebumps erupted on your neck and arms. 

My hands were rubbing a little lower, towards the waistline of your basketball shorts, and since my lips were right there anyway, I softly kissed your left ear, and then behind your ear, and then the side of your neck. As I did so, I slipped the fingers of my left hand ever so slightly into your waistband, and ran my hand from the left side to the right, just barely over the edge of your boxers. 

By this point you were practically hyperventilating, you were so turned on. And it wasn't just the noises you were making that showed me you wanted me. Even with basketball shorts, your cock was straining against your pants, and I could see your pulse, even through your shorts.

I continued to give you small, gentle little kisses on your neck, as I pulled my hand out of your pants.

You groaned with frustration again, but all I was doing was positioning myself in the backseat, all the better to reach lower. 

I didn't slip my hands down your pants again right away, though. Instead, I showed you that I was in tune with your reactions by slowly, gently rubbing my left hand over your shorts, over your huge, throbbing erection. You moaned again, and the combined sight, feel, sound, taste, and smell of you was turning me on as much as you were. My panties were already soaking wet, and even though we barely knew each other, I wanted nothing more than to please you, than to make you feel amazing, than to be the reason for your need, your pleasure, and your orgasm.

My right hand was still rubbing your chest, but I paused from this for a moment. Using both hands, I slowly, carefully pulled the knot out of the string of your basketball shorts. Then I tugged on them, so that you would know what I wanted. You were only too eager to slip them off. You tried to take your boxers off, too, but with a smile and a shake of my head, I held those in place. I was in no hurry to get you completely naked... I wanted to savor the experience, and I wanted to draw it out for you, too.

It was about this point in time when I climbed from the backseat to the front, and placed my knees on the center console. As I did, I removed my own jeans, and you hastily put up the side window covers (the front windshield's cover was already in place).

Kneeling on the center console, facing you, I kissed you full on the mouth, my hands still rubbing you down. Then I pushed your seat even farther back, and kissed you again. After a moment, my kisses began trailing down your jaw, your neck, and your shoulders.

Within moments I was kissing your strong, firm chest, licking between your pecs to your belly button, and kissing and licking the waistline of your boxers. My hands squeezed your hips and rubbed your erection. I licked from the left side of your belly to your right. Then I kissed you softly over your boxers, and I felt you jump underneath me. You were so hard, so turned on, that pre-come was soaking your boxers. You moaned and raised your hips to my mouth, and it was then that I pulled down your boxers.

You were looking down at yourself as I did so, and you saw the surprise on my face as your erection popped out from the confines of their fabric prison. You were incredibly hard, and the shape and size of you was perfect. I looked up at you in awe, and whispered, "Do you want me to?"

"Yes", you said, begging me with your eyes. "God, yes."

Your own hand slipped between my thighs, over my panties, and you groaned when you felt the wetness through them. I moaned, too, and grabbed your cock in my hands. 

"You're so fucking wet," you breathed as your fingers slipped my panties to the side. "I know," I mewed as I felt your index finger circling my clit. "Oh, that feels so good," I said, breathlessly. 

Gripping your cock in both of my hands, I slowly started to stroke up and down. My lips were centimeters from your cock, and I gently kissed the very tip of you. Your wetness coated my lips, and I licked them off. You tasted so sweet. There was pre-come leaking out of you in gushes at this point, and I used the tip of my own finger to spread it around the head of your cock. 

"Do you want me to keep kissing you there?" I asked, teasing at this point. By way of answer, you moaned again, and I decided to give you what you wanted so badly. What I wanted to do so badly.

I moved one of my hands, so that only my right hand was gripping the base of your cock. I held you straight up, looked up at you, and, maintaining eye contact, gave a long, slow, firm, flat-tongued lick from the very base of your shaft, all the way to the tip. Your eyes grew even wider, and you were breathing so hard at this point. As my tongue reached the head of your cock, I swirled it around in a circle, then, ever so softly, still looking into your eyes, gave the softest kiss I possibly could right on the tip of your cock.

You threw your head back, eyes closed, and moaned loudly. "Oh my fucking God, that feels good," you said.

And then I took you into my mouth. 

You're a big man, and I couldn't take you all the way at first. I slowly sucked you into my mouth as gently as I could, wrapping my lips around your shaft, then pulling you deep into my throat. As I pulled you back out, I made sure to suck tightly, and used my right hand to stroke you in time with my sucking.

Your own finger slipped inside my pussy. I was dripping wet by this point. "Take them off," you breathed. "Take those panties off." 

I gave a soft, high-pitched moan of agreement - my mouth still being occupied - and scrambled to pull my panties over my hips and down my legs. Your fingers began rubbing my lips faster, and I spread my knees as far apart as I could on the center console, the better for you to access me.

"Oh, please keep touching me," I begged you.

Your index finger rubbed me between my legs, a slow, firm stroke from my clit to my asshole, spreading around the wetness leaking from my pussy. 

I continued to suck and lick you eagerly, loving how turned on I was making you, melting with desire from your touch.

"I want to feel you inside me," I begged. And so you slipped a finger inside my pussy.

"Holy shit, you're tight!" you said. Even just your single index finger entering me, you found resistance. Your hesitated, then tried again. Swirling around the entrance to my pussy for a moment to lube your finger as much as possible, you slowly twisted your finger back and forth as you worked it in.

I had just taken you all the way down to my throat again, and I paused as you entered me. My mouth full of your cock, I moaned in pleasure as your finger slowly pushed into my pussy, until your entire finger disappeared. I leaned back against your finger, the deeper to feel you, and by this time we were both moaning in pleasure.

"Does that feel good?" you asked me.

"It feels so good," I whimpered. "Oh, please, don't stop."

You held your finger in place, and I felt you stroking a spot within me that made my legs shake.

I began vigorously sucking and stroking you, twisting my own head and hands, licking your tip, kissing your tip, licking you from base to tip, rubbing only my wet lips all over your cock (as you'd mentioned you'd always wanted a woman to do.) 

We were both hyperventilating at this point, and your finger was sliding back and forth within me faster at this point.

And then.... You had to go to work.
