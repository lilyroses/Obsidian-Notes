# The First Encounter (of the Regular Kind)
#memories #journal 

I remember just about everything from the first time we met.

It was nighttime. Cartoon had just died, and I'd been staying at Billy's house at nights and running the streets by day. I'd just gotten Princess from Billy, and I had her with me at the Stater Bros where we first met.

I'd also picked up a follower, Bugsy, I think the day before. Smitten with me, Bugsy had been following me around, helping me carry things, or offering to do menial tasks for me. I had taken him up on the offer to get me 2 jugs of water for Princess, since I couldn't take her inside Stater Bros. It was there that I was sitting, on the curb to the left of the door, with Bugsy and Princess, when you pulled up in your white Hyundai Sonata, with Bully in the passenger seat.

Bully motioned for Bugsy to come over, and a second later Bugsy returned to ask me if I had anything, because Bully needed to get well. I said that I did, and he told me to hop in your car. I walked to the back door, opened it, and asked if it was okay if I brought my dog.

You quickly said it was fine, so me, Bugsy, and Princess all piled into the backseat.

I introduced myself, and Bully introduced you as "YG". You looked young, around my age, and you looked like you were probably from the hood. I wondered at this, because I'd never seen you nor heard of you. I quickly dismissed this on grounds that I barely knew anyone from South Side anyway.

My second thought of you was that you were really, really skinny! I thought you were maybe sick or something. (I'm sure I didn't look too healthy myself - although maybe I did, I'd just spent the prior 8 months being fattened up by Cartoon's mom. But we all know how quickly those pounds gained are lost.) 

Apparently you were interested in me, too, because I found out later that you had asked Bugsy about me - mouthing the words, "Is she down to fuck?" at him. And according to you, Bugsy said yes! Which is crazy - how would he even know? But I guess that's just how you dummy guys work. Good thing I didn't find this out til way later, anyway - I probably wouldn't have hit you up again.

But, as it were, I thought you were respectful, and there was something about the way you carried yourself that I liked - you seemed confident, assertive, and sure of yourself, yet also quiet, not arrogant, and
