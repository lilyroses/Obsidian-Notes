- **Backstory:**
	- Taught by her single mother, a once high-up member of the **Thieves Guild**, Ranna was a promising junior member of the underground society until bad luck befell their numbers. After her mother was killed by Orc guards, she looked elsewhere than her home city for fortune, seeking riches all throughout Skyrim.
	- Preferring to **move by night**, she is nothing if not clever, cunning, and conniving.
	- She is not racist but **hates Orcs**, due to their part in her mother's untimely demise.
	- She prefers to judge another on their mental capacity than brawn.
	- She is **allergic to wildflowers**.
	- She is weak of body **cannot stand back breaking work**.
	- She prefers **horseback to walking** and is a strong horsewoman. If she could, she would own **every horse** in Skyrim.
	- She will **never say no to the right job** - after all, everyone has a price, as her motto goes. 
	- She **hates bartering**, **preferring to steal.**
	- She absolutely **detests members of the Werewolves Guild**.
	- She also **sneers upon farmers and merchants**. 
	- She has a **soft spot** for:
		- Orphans
		- Old people
		- Animals
		- Family
	- Won't bother to help:
		- Spoiled brats
		- Men who whine
		- Women who are whores
	- Her weakness is her **greed** and her taste for **fancy lifestyles**.
	- She also has a strong affinity for **any kind of soup and bread**.
	- She abhors apples.
	- She has been imprisoned more than once and as such is an **accomplished lockpick**.
	- She **does not drink**, but will gladly down any Moonsugar she can find.
	- **Necromancy**, **offensive magic**, and **assassinations** are right up her alley.
	- **Healing spells**, **defensive magic**, and **charms** are not.



- **Disposition:** Bright, funny, clever, witty, sarcastic, biting, impatient, loyal, fast-thinking, ride-or-die


- **Personality:** Wry, realistic, not cynical, but certainly not fawningly optimistic. Opportunist, generous with friends, greedy with opponents/those of higher means. Sees herself as a rogue Lady Robinhood type of character. Soft spots for the weak and preyed upon. Sometimes bites off more than she can chew - but she will NEVER Admit It!
