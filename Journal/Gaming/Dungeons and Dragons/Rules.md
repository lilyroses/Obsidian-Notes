## Dice 

The following set of **dice** are required for use in all Dungeons and Dragons adventures.

There are 6 types of **dice**, each with a different number of sides (**d[n]**).

Some **dice** types required more than one die, such as the *6-sided die* (**d6**), which requires **four**(4) such **dice** for gameplay.

There are also [[Rules#Percentile Dice|percentile dice]], which use 2 **d10** to generate a number between 1-100.

**Dice** are used to determine the outcome of any **action** a **character** attempts.
These outcomes are called **[[Rules#Checks|checks]]**.

| Die Type | Sides | Quantity |
| -------- | ----- | -------- |
| **d4**   | 4     | 1        |
| **d6**   | 6     | 4        |

#### Percentile Dice

- **d**`%` : 2 10-sided die
- Choose color for the tens die and the other for the ones die. Roll both, 
- and combine the numbers to generate a number between 1-100.

---

### Dice Rollsg
Every **action** in the game is accomplished (or failed) with a roll of the **dice**.

Each action's outcome is determined with a roll of the dice, using different **checks**:
- **Skill checks**
- **Ability checks**
- **Attack rolls**

**Dice rolls** are described with expressions, such as:

> 3**d4**`+3` , which means "roll 3 4-sided dice and add 3 to the number."

> **d**`%`  [[Rules#Percentile Dice|Percentile Dice]], "roll 2 10-sided dice, and combine them to make a number between 1-100."
