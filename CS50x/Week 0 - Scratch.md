## Concept

You are a space traveller and you find a planet full of translucent aliens. These aliens are able to change color at will, and, as a demonstration for your arrival, they would like to show you their abilities.

From a selection of "colors" (circles), choose a color, and the aliens (ghosts) will change color and dance.


- Set each circle at its start position
	- for each circle:
		- x, y
		- color
		- size (same for ALL circles)


- Set each ghost at its start position
	- for each ghost:
		- x, y (different)
		- color (same)
		- size (different )



- Create dance routine for ghosts


- When RED CIRCLE clicked:
	- set favorite color to RED

- if favorite color == RED
	- dance routine
