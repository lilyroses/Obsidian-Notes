### Terminology

---

#### A



---

##### Access Token

Used instead of a password to carry out Git operations over HTTPS with Git on the command line or the API.

A.K.A.: *personal access token*

---

##### Add

*See git commands: [[Git#Commands#git add|git add]]*

---

##### Archive

A Git archive is synonymous to a Git [[Git#Repository|repository]] (for arch Linux users).

---

#### B



---

##### Base Branch

The branch into which changes are combined when you [[Git#Merge|merge]] a [[Git#Pull Request|pull request]].

When a pull request is created, you can change the base branch from the [[Git#Repository|repository's]] default [[Git#Branch|branch]] to another branch if required.

---

##### Branch

Parallel version of a [[Git#Repository|repository]].

Contained within the repository, but does not affect the primary (main) branch, so you can edit your project without disrupting the "live" version of the code.

To update changes made to a branch, [[Git#Merge|merge]] your branch back into the main branch.

*See also:*

- [[Git#Base Branch|base branch]]
- [[Git#Default Branch|default branch]]

---

##### Checkout

*See git commands: [[Git#git checkout|git checkout]]*

The "checkout" action updates part or all of the [[Git#Working Tree|working tree]] with a tree object from the object database, and updates the index and [[Git#HEAD|HEAD]] if the whole working tree is pointing to a new [[Git#Branch|branch]].
